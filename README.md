# vis.js-timeline-experiments
Converting old MIT SIMILE site to vis.js

PHP, JSON based stand-alone files (no database).

Pages are loaded with buttons to [load] and [save] JSON from a file on the server.

vis.js is used to format the JSON as a timeline.

Below the timeline, a textarea displays the JSON which can be edited and saved back to the file on the server. NOTE: file is overwritten on every save.

To use, load on PHP server, browse to index.html then explore links to get to the subfolders containing the pages with timelines.
